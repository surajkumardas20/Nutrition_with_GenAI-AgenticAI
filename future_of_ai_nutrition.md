# The Future of Nutrition Science with GenAI & Agentic AI

## 🌱 Current Challenges
- Generic diet plans that ignore individuality
- Limited ability to continuously monitor patient health
- Manual analysis of large datasets

## 🤖 How AI Changes the Game
### Generative AI (GenAI)
- Creates customized meal plans from patient data
- Generates recipes based on dietary restrictions
- Provides educational material in natural language

### Agentic AI
- Functions as a **nutrition co-pilot**: autonomous, adaptive, always-on
- Integrates with wearables, medical devices, and health apps
- Detects anomalies (e.g., sudden glucose spikes) and updates diet in real-time
- Coordinates with physicians for medication-diet synergy

## 🔬 Research Possibilities
- AI-driven clinical trials in nutrition
- Population-level dietary modeling
- Simulated outcomes of interventions before applying to humans

## 🌍 Impact
- Better patient outcomes
- Reduced diet-related diseases
- Accessible, affordable nutrition advice at scale
