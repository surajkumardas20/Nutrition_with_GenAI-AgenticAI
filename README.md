# GenAI & Agentic AI in Nutrition Science

This repository explores how Generative AI (GenAI) and Agentic AI can transform the future of nutrition science.

## 🚀 Vision
Nutrition science is moving beyond static diet charts and rigid guidelines. With the rise of AI, especially GenAI and Agentic AI, we can build **dynamic, adaptive, and personalized nutrition systems**.

## 🔑 Key Ideas
- **Generative AI** creates tailored meal plans, recipes, and lifestyle recommendations.
- **Agentic AI** acts as an autonomous agent: monitoring health data, adjusting diets in real time, and even interacting with healthcare systems.
