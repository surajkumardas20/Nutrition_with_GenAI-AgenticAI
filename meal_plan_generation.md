# Example: AI Meal Plan Generation

Using GenAI, we can input a patientâ€™s age, weight, health condition, and dietary preference, and generate a **personalized 7-day meal plan**.

### Input:
- Age: 40
- Condition: Type 2 Diabetes
- Goal: Reduce glucose spikes

### GenAI Output:
- Day 1: Oats with chia seeds, spinach dal, grilled tofu with quinoa
- Day 2: Vegetable poha, brown rice with legumes, baked salmon
- ...

The AI adjusts macros and calories daily, and Agentic AI ensures the patient sticks to it by giving reminders and making substitutions if ingredients are unavailable.
